# Tidy-Data
Programming Assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains files based on a dataset from the University of California, Irvine. Thirty volunteers from the ages of 19 to 48 performed six activities while wearing a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone on their waist. These activities were: (1) walking, (2) walking upstairs, (3) walking downstairs, (4) sitting, (5) standing, and (6) laying. Using the accelerometer and gyroscope embedded in the smartphones, researchers measured their acceleration and velocity across three spatial axes. The files in this repository are: (1) R code for organizing and reshaping the dataset, (2) text file with tidy dataset resulting from this code, and (3) codebook defining the variables in the dataset.
